Going through [Programming Language Foundations in Agda](https://plfa.github.io/).

This requires the `Agda` [standard-library](https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib) to run.

## Differences with the book

Some things are named differently due to either preference or what unicode I have "easily available" (due to using [agda-vim](https://github.com/derekelkins/agda-vim)).

* `_≲_` from `plfa.Isomorphism` is `_≼_` instead (easier to type, already accessible from `agda-vim` )
